## 🎯 Project Objective
The core objective of this project was to transition from theoretical circuit design to a high-density, professional SMD hardware product. 

**The Idea:** Most student interfaces rely on bulky mechanical switches. I designed this "Credit Card" form factor interface that uses capacitive sensing to trigger a high-speed MOSFET switch. It serves as a standalone demonstrator or a modular input device for larger engineering systems.

## 🔬 Technical Specifications (BOM)

| Component | Footprint | Value | Engineering Logic |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Touch Sensor** | SOT-23-6 | U1 | High-sensitivity capacitive detection in a tiny footprint. |
| **N-MOSFET** | SOT-23 | Q1 | Low gate-threshold voltage for reliable logic-level switching. |
| **Battery Cell** | CR2032 | BT1 | Slim 3V power source suited for the "Card" form factor. |
| **SMD LEDs** | 0805 | x6 | Current-optimized array for visual feedback. |
| **Passive Parts** | 0805 | 22nF - 10uF | Decoupling and signal stabilization for the sensor IC. |

## 🧠 Engineering Design Decisions

### 1️⃣ Why these components?
* **0805 SMD over THT:** Through-hole is for breadboards; 0805 is for products. It keeps the card thin while remaining hand-solderable.
* **BSS138 MOSFET over Relays:** Silent, fast, and solid-state. No mechanical wear and tear.
* **CR2032 over Li-Po:** Avoids the complexity of charging ICs. Simple, safe, and efficient for low-power use.

### 2️⃣ Trace Width & Routing Strategy
> **The Rule:** Wider for power, thinner for signal.

* **⚡ Power Paths (0.50 mm):** The "Highway." Prevents voltage drop so all 6 LEDs shine with equal brightness.
* **📟 Signal Lines (0.25 mm):** The "Side Streets." Optimized to snake between small SMD pads without causing shorts.
* **🔋 Battery Pads (1.00 mm+):** The "Foundation." Provides mechanical strength for the battery holder clips.
